Update `Decryption(...)` and `Encryption(...)` to make then more secure, and add new function, some new function is use library from nodejs modules, named `crypto` 

## 1.1.0 (27/2, 2022)
Found that the encryption function is insecure, if the encryption process is obtained, it can be directly decrypted without the need for encryption style. So I changed the encryption method, which may be more secure.
